## Deep Learning Concepts

- Number of parameters is defined by the model, and the model is generated by the relationship between input and output.
- To acchive an advanded and hierarchical representation of the relationship between input and output is the goel of deep learning
- Needs of large set of training data, ususally comes with test data to verify the output model

## Tensors
